# 2048

The perpus of this project is to implement, the minimalist game, 2048. After the introduction of functional programming, I needed a playground to manipulate its concepts. Knowing that JS handle natively some part of functionnal programming feature, I've used this language.

The project is self-supporting which means that none external librairy is used. The project doesn't need to be build to work.

# What I Learned

* Use functionnal programming paradigm
* Use none librairy, only vanilla code
* Decorrelate the game mechanism from the render
* & much more

# Usage

```shell
git clone git@github.com:LoicSikidi/2048.git
cd 2048
npx open web.html
```

* Use arrow keys, wasd or zqsd to move the grid
* Try to merge squares of same values to reach 2048!
